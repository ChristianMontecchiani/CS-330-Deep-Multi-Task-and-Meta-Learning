            one-hot vectors would be useful.

            2. For shuffling, remember to make sure images and labels are shuffled
            in the same order, otherwise the one-to-one mapping between images
            and labels may get messed up. Hint: we encourage you to use
            np.random.shuffle here.
            
            3. The value for `self.num_samples_per_class` will be set to K+1 
            since for K-shot classification you need to sample K supports and 
            1 query.

            4. PyTorch uses float32 as default for representing model parameters. 
            You would need to return numpy arrays with the same datatype
